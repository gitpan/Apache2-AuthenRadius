Revision history for Perl extension Apache2::AuthenRadius.


0.4  Mon Apr 18 10:30:30 2005
	- Modified from Apache::AuthenRadius
	- Clean up the package a bit 
        - Uses its own password checking subroutine to
          allow returning all possible values
	- Added logic for checking a primary and 
          secondary RADIUS servers
        - Allows for better username validation
	- The package now informs the RADIUS servers
          about the NAS-IP-Address to use when 
          checking
	- Logging reporting modified to give a better
          idea of what's going on
	- Added enough comments to make it easily 
          understandable
